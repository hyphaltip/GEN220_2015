      # Introduction to UNIX (II)

      All about Files and Executing Applications

      ---
      # Outline

      1. How to copy, rename files in UNIX

      2. How to run programs and UNIX PATH

      3. Redirecting output, creating files

      4. Connecting programs with Pipes
      
      5. The power of the commandline: Wildcards

      ---
      # Copy files

      ```cp``` to make a copy of a file or directory
      ```shell
      $ cp one.txt two.txt      # copy one file to another
      
      $ mkdir books             # make a directory
      $ cp one.txt books        # copy into a directory
      $ ls books                # list the contents
      one.txt
      
      $ cp books more_books     # copy the folder, will fail
      cp: books is a directory (not copied).
      
      $ cp -r books more_books  # recursive copy succeeds

      $ cp one.txt two.txt books # can copy more than one at a time
                                 # will also OVERWRITE the previous
                                 # one.txt that was in the folder
      $ ls books

      $ ls more_books
      ```
      
      ---
      # Move files

      ```mv``` to move a file
      
      This is essentially the same thing as renaming. The absolute path
      that designates a file is simply being changed when something is
      moved.

      ```shell
      $ mv one.txt three.txt     # rename one.txt to three.txt
      $ mv three.txt books       # relocate three.txt to books folder

      $ cd books
      $ mv one.txt two.txt three.txt .. # move these files back UP one
      directory
      $ ls                       # nothing in the 'books' directory
      $ cd ..                    # go back
      $ ls                       # these files are in the current folder
      one.txt two.txt three.txt books more_books
      $ ls books                 # is now empty, we moved everything
                                 # out of there
      
      ```
