      # Introduction to UNIX (II)

      All about Files and Executing Applications

      ---
      # Outline

      1. How to copy, rename files in UNIX

      2. How to run programs and UNIX PATH

      3. Redirecting output, creating files

      4. Connecting programs with Pipes
      
      5. The power of the commandline: Wildcards

      ---
      # Copy files

      ```cp``` to make a copy of a file or directory
      
      ```shell
      $ cp one.txt two.txt      # copy one file to another
      
      $ mkdir books             # make a directory
      $ cp one.txt books        # copy into a directory
      $ ls books                # list the contents
      one.txt
      
      $ cp books more_books     # copy the folder, will fail
      cp: books is a directory (not copied).
      
      $ cp -r books more_books  # recursive copy succeeds

      $ cp one.txt two.txt books # can copy more than one at a time
                                 # will also OVERWRITE the previous
                                 # one.txt that was in the folder
      $ ls books

      $ ls more_books
      ```
      
      ---
      # Move files

      ```mv``` to move a file
      
      This is essentially the same thing as renaming. The absolute path
      that designates a file is simply being changed when something is
      moved.

      ```shell
      $ mv one.txt three.txt     # rename one.txt to three.txt
      $ mv three.txt books       # relocate three.txt to books folder

      $ cd books
      $ mv one.txt two.txt three.txt .. # move these files back UP one
      directory
      $ ls                       # nothing in the 'books' directory
      $ cd ..                    # go back
      $ ls                       # these files are in the current folder
      one.txt two.txt three.txt books more_books
      $ ls books                 # is now empty, we moved everything
                                 # out of there      
      ```

      # Running processes


      ---
      # The PATH variable

      How does UNIX determine what program to run when

      * Try to do ```echo $PATH``` to see your search directory
      * Also do ```env``` to see all environment variables
      * Open a new terminal window; type
      ```shell
      $ set PATH=""
      # try running any program, eg ls or hostname, etc
      # will fail because PATH is now empty
      ```
            
      ---
      # Counting lines with ```wc```

      Word counting with ```wc``` is a simple task.

      ```shell
      $ echo "hello world" | wc
            1       2      12
      # process a file
      ```

      ---
      # Setting on the sysytem with .bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile

      How the shell determines what variables to set and load is based
      on a series of system and local configuration files.

      ---
      # Back to running programs

      * UNIX gives you control over doing things with the network
      
      ```shell
      $ hostname                   # name of your computer
      $ ping -c 3 www.ucr.edu      # send 3 packets of info to host,
                                   # count how long it takes to get back
      $ ping -c 3 www.bbc.co.uk      
      ```
      
      ---
      # redirect output

      * '>'
      * '>>'
      * '<'
      *
