      #Introduction to UNIX (II)

      All about Files and Executing Applications

      ---
      # Outline
      
      1. Copy, rename files in UNIX
      
      2. Run programs and UNIX PATH
      
      3. Redirecting output, creating files
      
      4. Connecting programs with Pipes
      
      5. The power of the command line: Wildcards
      
      ---
      # Copy files
      
      __`cp`__ to make a copy of a file or directory
      
      ```shell
      $ cp one.txt two.txt# copy one file to another

      $ mkdir books # make a directory
      $ cp one.txt books        # copy into a directory
      $ ls books                # list the contents
      one.txt
      
      $ cp books more_books     # copy the folder, will fail
      cp: books is a directory (not copied).
      
      $ cp -r books more_books  # recursive copy succeeds
      
      $ cp one.txt two.txt books # can copy more than one at a time
                                 # will also OVERWRITE the previous
                                 # one.txt that was in the folder
      $ ls books

      $ ls more_books
      ```

      ---
      # Move files

      __`mv`__ to move a file
      
      This is essentially the same thing as renaming. The absolute path
      that designates a file is simply being changed when something is
      moved.

      ```shell
      $ mv one.txt three.txt     # rename one.txt to three.txt
      $ mv three.txt books       # relocate three.txt to books folder

      $ cd books
      $ mv one.txt two.txt three.txt .. # move these files back UP one
      directory
      $ ls                       # nothing in the 'books' directory
      $ cd ..                    # go back
      $ ls                       # these files are in the current folder
      one.txt two.txt three.txt books more_books
      $ ls books                 # is now empty, we moved everything
                                 # out of there      
      ```
      
      ---
      # Let's Try it!

      Open up your terminal and let's do a few examples
      =================================================

      ---
      # The PATH variable
      
      How does UNIX determine what program to run?
      
      * Try __`echo $PATH`__ to see your search directory
      * Also do __`env`__ to see all environment variables
      * Open a new terminal window; type
      
      ```shell
      $ export PATH=""
      # try running any program, eg ls or hostname, etc
      # will fail because PATH is now empty      
      ```
      
      * You can use the command __`which`__ to determine the path to an executable

      ```shell
      $ which nano            # will tell you where the nano program
                              # is located
      ```
      ---
      # Some useful commands

      * __`wc`__      - count the number of lines,words,characters
      * __`tail`__    - see the last N lines of a file
      * __`head`__    - see the first N lines of a file
      * __`cat`__     - print out entire file to screen
      * __`sed`__     - 'stream editor' - edit data stream on the fly
      * __`curl`__    - downloading tool for web/ftp data streams
      * __`which`__   - list path to a program based on the $PATH
      * __`pwd`__     - print the current working directory
      * __`ps`__      - processes running on the system
      * __`man`__     - view manual pages about a command or program
      * __`date`__    - date and time
      * __`time`__    - prefix a command/program, report how long it
      took to run
      * __`find`__    - find files/folders by name or other property
      * __`du`__      - reports disk usage (e.g. how big a file or
      folder is)
      * __`awk`__     - a simple language for processing files/great
      for column delimited data


      ---
      # Counting lines with __`wc`__

      Word counting with __`wc`__ is a simple task.

      ```shell
      $ echo "hello world" | wc
            1       2      12
      # process a file
      $ wc -l data/Nc20H.expr.tab
          9734 Nc20H.expr.tab
      ```


      ---
      # Network access

      UNIX gives you access to many utilities to talk to the network
      
      ```shell
      $ hostname                   # name of your computer
      ZyGoAir
      $ ping -c 3 www.ucr.edu      # send 3 packets of info to host,
                                   # count how long it takes to get back
      PING www.ucr.edu (138.23.226.208): 56 data bytes

      # Other important commands when running programs

      Sometimes something will go wrote, you need to kill/quit the
      program or you need to suspend the program and come back to it
      (This is one the powerful things about UNIX).
      
      * Control-C - cancel out of the program (exiting it). Try
      this:
      ```shell
      $ cat          # whatever you type will be re-echoed.
       # To exit type Control-C
      ```
      * Control-D - sends and End of File (EOF) message
      ```shell
      $ cat          # whatever you type will be re-echoed.
       # To exit can also type Control-D, this also tells cat the
       # "file" is over
      ```

      ---
      # Process control
      
      Control-Z - This send a suspend message to a program that is
      running. To bring it to 
      ```shell
      $ ping www.ucr.edu  # will keep running till you hit Control-C
      64 bytes from 138.23.226.208: icmp_seq=3 ttl=241 time=33.058 ms
      64 bytes from 138.23.226.208: icmp_seq=4 ttl=241 time=34.757 ms
      # but instead, type Control-Z
      [2]+  Stopped                 ping www.ucr.edu
      # now put it into the background
      $ bg
      64 bytes from 138.23.226.208: icmp_seq=22 ttl=241 time=44.175 ms
      64 bytes from 138.23.226.208: icmp_seq=23 ttl=241 time=41.319 ms
      # it will continue to run now in the background
      # bring it back to the foreground with 'fg'
      $ fg # still running
      64 bytes from 138.23.226.208: icmp_seq=5 ttl=241 time=32.900 ms
      64 bytes from 138.23.226.208: icmp_seq=6 ttl=241 time=33.840 ms      
      # now cancel it with Control-C
      ```
      If you have more than one process in the background, __`fg`__
      will bring up the most recent one. You can switch to a
      particular one using the name
      ```shell
      $ fg ping
      # or use the job number
      $ fg 2 # since it said [2]+  Stopped ...
      # can report the currently background jobs with
      $ jobs
      [2]+  Running                 ping www.ucr.edu      
      ```
      ---
      # ps for process information

      you can see all the processes you are running with __`ps`__

      
      ```shell
      $ ps
        PID TTY           TIME CMD
      35995 ttys000    0:00.13 -bash
      36064 ttys001    0:00.23 -bash
      36525 ttys001    0:00.79 ssh pigeon
      36150 ttys002    0:00.17 -bash
      36597 ttys003    0:00.08 -bash

      $ ps -a # show a longer version
      35991 ttys000    0:03.17 login -fp stajich
      35995 ttys000    0:00.13 -bash
      36063 ttys001    0:00.02 login -fp stajich
      36064 ttys001    0:00.23 -bash
      41211 ttys005    0:00.00 cat
      ```
      ---
      # Killing jobs
      
      If you have a runaway process you need to stop you can also use
      the __`kill`__ command
      ```shell
      $ kill 41211
      Terminated: 15
      ```
      Sometimes jobs are hard to kill - suspended or locked up use
      special option -9 which sends a "Hard Quit" to the program
      ```shell
      $ kill -9 41211
      Killed: 9
      ```

      For those in need of a humourous song about the importance of this command (Note:
      explicit lyrics!) you can hear CS student/Rapper's take on the
      command [Monzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGjtlsKo4s)

      # Data download with __`curl`__

      __`curl`__ to download data from any URL (http://, ftp://)

      ```shell
      $ curl http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/E3Q6S8.fasta
      >tr|E3Q6S8|E3Q6S8_COLGM RNAse P Rpr2/Rpp21/SNM1 subunit domain-containing protein

      $ curl -o myseqfile.fa  http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/E3Q6S8.fasta
      ```
      There are some other similar commands that may be installed on
      other systems
      * wget - also gets web/FTP on commandline
      * ncftpget - for ftp
      * lftp - a command line FTP client - also works for http/web
      
      ---
      # Redirect output

      * `>` - write out the output to file (create it if empty, and
      overwrite if exists)
      ```shell
      $ curl http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/E3Q6S8.fasta > E3Q6S8.fa
      ```
      * `>>` - write out output to a file (create it if empty) but
      append to the end of the file
      ```shell
      $ echo "my name is " >> what_is_my name
      $ echo "Joe" >> what_is_my_name
      $ cat what_is_my_name
      my name is
      Joe
      ```

      * &lt; - This is for redirecting INPUT from a file. We'll talk
      about this more but is how we might pull a set of commands into
      a program expecting input 
      ```shell
      R --no-save &lt; My_R_commands.R
      ```

      ---
      # Compression

      File compression is important for saving space on disks. Also
      for transferring data between hosts, compressed files will take
      less time to transfer

      1. __`gzip`__ for GNUzip compression. Single file at a time.
         (biocluster) pigz is parallelized and can use multiple
      processors
      ```shell
      $ du -h data/Nc20H.expr.tab        # report how big the file is
      656K	data/Nc20H.expr.tab
      $ gzip data/Nc20H.expr.tab         # to compress
      $ du -h data/Nc20H.expr.tab.gz     # report size of compressed file 
      236K	data/Nc20H.expr.tab.gz
      $ gunzip data/Nc20H.expr.tab.gz    # to uncompress
      ```      
      2. __`bzip2`__ for Bzip compression. Better compression than gzip
      but slower. (biocluster) pbzip2 is parallelized and can use multiple processors
      ```shell
      $ bzip2 data/Nc20H.expr.tab        # compress with bzip2
      $ du -h data/Nc20H.expr.tab.bz2    # report size of bzipped file
      204K	data/Nc20H.expr.tab.bz2
      $ bunzip2 data/Nc20H.expr.tab.bz2
      ```
      3. zcat, zmore and bzcat, bzmore to read files on the fly
      (without uncompressing entire file at once)

      ---
      # File / disk usage with __du__

      * -h -- human readable (eg bytes, K, G, and T)
      
      ```shell
      $ du -h data/Nc20H.expr.tab        # report how big the file is
      ```

      ---
      # Manual pages with __`man`__

      __`man`__ prints out a manual page for a program or command

      ```shell
      $ man ls
      NAME
       ls - list directory contents

      SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

      DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
      Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.
      
      Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      ```
      
      ---
      # Setting on the system preferences with .bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile

      How the shell determines what variables to set and load is based
      on a series of system and local configuration files. These are
      the initialization options that are setup every time a shell is
      run - when you login or if you type __`bash`__ you start a new
      shell session.

      PATH and all other variables set in these files. They can be
      dependancies on other files, so multiple places can be sourced
      for these parameters.
      
      Other environment variables are important when we start to
      install Python (PYTHONPATH) or Perl (PERL5LIB) or other
      libraries.

      If you make changes and want to immediately see the difference
      without logging out/logging back in. Use
      ```shell
      $ source ~/.bash_profile
      ```

      # Connecting programs with pipes

      There are three types of data streams in UNIX

      * STDOUT - standard output stream (stream 1)
      * STDERR - standard error stream (stream 2)
      * STDIN  - standard input stream (stream 0)

      When run a program and it prints to screen, that is usually
      STDOUT. This can be captured with &gt; to redirect to a file.
      ```shell
      $ ls > listing.txt
      listing.txt
      one.txt
      ```

      ---
      # STDERR error message capture
      
      If there are error messages they go to the STDERR stream this
      can be captured
      ```shell
      $ ls JUNK >> listing.txt
      $ cat listing.txt
      listing.txt
      one.txt
      $ ls JUNK 2>> listing.txt
      listing.txt
      one.txt
      ls: JUNK: No such file or directory # this is an error message
      $ program 1> log 2> err # STDOUT to one file, STDERR to another
      $ program >& all_output # combine STDOUT and STDERR
      ```
      ---
      # Piping program output

      The pipe operator | allows you to instead of redirecting output
      to a file, redirect it to another program. Specifically the
      STDIN of the other program. This is very powerful and allows you
      to chain together different processes

      ```shell
      $ zcat data/Nc20H.expr.tab.gz | wc -l
      # output from zcat is printed to STDOUT and that is redirected
      # to the command wc with the -l option which in turn
      # expects input on STDIN.

      # Output from a program can be fed to a pager like less
      $ blastn -help | less
      $ fasta36 query db | more
      $ fasta36 query db | tee report.out | more
      ```

      __`tee`__ is a program which reads from STDIN and writes this
      BOTH to a file and to STDOUT. A way to monitor a program but to
      also detach from reading the messages and still capture it all
      to a file.
      
      ---
      # Building pieces into useful, reusable components

      Multiple pipes can be used, and building together we can start
      to construct a series of queries. Will go into this more in
      detail in the next lecture but here we process a file and
      capture
      ```shell
      # shows top ten results from a blast report
      $ zcat data/blast.out.gz | head -n 10
      # returns the total number of unique items found in column 1
      $ zcat data/blast.out.gz | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l
      # take output from blast program, compress it on the fly to a
      new file
      $ blastn -query query.fa -db db.fa -outfmt 6 | gzip -c > blastresult.out.gz
      ```

      ---
      # Wildcards on the commandline

      * use the '*' to match anything
      * use '?' to match any character 1 time
      * indicate specific characters in '[]'

      ```shell
      $ ls [A-Za-z]*.jpg # match JPG files with names starting with a
      letter
      ```
      [more]
      ---
      # Fin

      Practice these commands. Many concepts but these are the heart
