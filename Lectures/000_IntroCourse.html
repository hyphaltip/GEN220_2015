      # Course Logistics
      1. Meeting in University Laboratory Building (ULB) Bioinformatics suite
      2. Wednesdays scheduled for 2 hrs, Fridays for 1hr. Can extend
      this to 2 hrs on Friday with workshops if helpful.
      3. Expect to have a mix of in-class workshops and
      lectures. Homework problem sets will be assigned to give you
      more practice and improve skills
      3. Laptops are available during class setting, but you will need
      to have access to a computer outside of class to complete assignments 
      4. Accounts to the IIGB Biocluster will be provided during the
      course. Most work will not require advanced tools on the cluster however.

      # Grading
      1. Homeworks (5 in total) will be worth 50% of the grade
      2. Team project - presentation, written report and code repository worth 50% of grade.
      3. You are expected to attend class - this is graduate school -
      so I don't take attendance. If you need be absent do let me
      know. Material will be presented from the slides, but also lots
      of hands on activities
      4. Your work is expected to be your own. Google is a useful tool
      to find solutions, and resuse is part of coding. However, you need to work on understanding the
      steps in your code so what you turn in should be a reflection of
      your own efforts.

      # Homework
      1. Turned in via iLearn.
      2. Code can be submitted if a single script or you should plan
      to make a (github)[http://github.com] repository for the class and point me to your answers
      in a particular sub-folder.
