      # Outline

      1. The command line shell
      2. Directories and Files
      3. Running programs
      4. Input and Output

      # Introduction
      * UNIX is an environment which give a power interface to running
      applications and access to data
      * Strengths are when you build something that can automate your
      work in data analysis. Challenges are learning your way around
      thinking on the command line
      * Even though we'll focus on text-based command line (Command
      Line Interface-CLI) there are rich graphical tools built in UNIX
      as well - display is through the X11 system.
      * Sometimes it feels like _Magic_ because there are special
      words/incantations you have to use to get something done - but
      there are tools to help you search for the right tool (including Google)

      # Command line

      1. Breakdown of the syntax
      2. The prompt - can look like
      ```$```
      ```[host]
      3. Where you run commands
      
      ---
      # Directories and listing

      1. ls
      2. ls has many command options

      ---
      # Directories: Creating and Deleting

      1. mkdir - make directory
      2. rmdir - remove directory
      3. ls -d will display a directory name only
      4. ls -F will give a different symbol for directories

      ---
      # Navigating paths

      1. to go into a directory use 'cd'
      2. to go back a level use 'cd ..'
      3. learning to navigate these levels and directories will take
      some thinking
      4. On the Mac you can see the same directories and files
      organized graphically too
      5. SWCarpentry has a nice intro with graphics [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-filedir.html)

      # Files

      1. touch will create an empty file
      2.

      ---
      # Permissions

      1. ls -l will show a long version of listing output

      ---
      # Deleting things (careful!)

      1. rm - for removing files
      2. rm -r -- _be careful_ removes recursively
      3. rm -f - removes without prompting you
      4. rm -rf - removes recurisvely without prompty __Use with care__
      ---
      # File content

      Want to read the content of a text file you can use these
      commands 
      1. cat - will spit out the whole file on the screen
      2. more - a paginator - will display one page at a time (based
      on your screen)
      3. less - similar to more, but has additional options

      ---
      # Editors

      1. pico
      2. emacs, vi, nano
      3. TextEdit on OSX
