#Concepts to cover today

* Using the terminal on your mac laptop
* The command-line interface to UNIX 
* Directories & Files
* Running programs

---
#What is the command line?

* Shell - an interative 

---
#Access to the Shell

---
#Using the terminal

* In the Applications / Utilities Folder
* Are other programs useful with add-ons ([iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/))
* Can copy and paste within the terminal or from other programs

---
#Command prompt
* This is where all the work happens
* The prompt will have a '$' or a '%' usually
* Sometimes the prompt will include the current directory you are in

        me@biocluster:/data/squid/ $
		john@tombstone:/home/john %

* It can be customized so that colors, extra notifications can show
  up
* Running a program on the command line by typing and hitting enter

        $ ls

---
#Directories (folders)

* Listing files in a directory

        $ ls
		$ ls -l

* making a directory

        $ mkdir mynewdir

* changing directories

        $ cd mynewdir # go in
		$ cd ..       # go back
		$ cd ~        # go HOME
		$ cd          # go HOME
		$ cd ../mynewdir/text # go to another directory

* removing directories

        $ rmdir mynewdir
		
---
#Listing contents

* Listing files in a directory with `ls`
* Other options `ls -l` for long listing
* The long listint can give you information on how big the files are too
* `ls -lt` shows listing ordered by date
* `man ls` will give you more information on

        $ cd /srv/projects/db/ncbi/current
		$ ls -l

#Files

* Files are the oh of what will work with in UNIX
* Can create them in editors and many other programs 
* The command `touch` will create an empty file
* Files are the results of other programs running


---
#Moving and renaming files
* Moving files or directories to new locations
* Renaming files is just moving them to a new name
* Multiple things can be moved into a directory as long as the
  directory is the last argument

		$ touch testfil1 # make an empty file called 'testfil1'
		$ mv testfil1 testfile1 # rename the filename
		$ mkdir newdir # make a new directory
		$ mv testfile1 newdir # put the file in a directory
		$ touch testfile2 testfile3 # make 2 more files
		$ mv testfile2 testfile3 newdir # move them both into the directory
		# mv newdir oldir # rename the newdir to 'oldir'
		# mkdir another_dir # make a new folder
		# mv oldir another_dir # move the 'oldir' folder into this new dir



---
#Copying files

* the command `cp` for copying
* If you want to copy a whole directory use `cp -r` for recursive copy
* Tools like `rsync` can copy but are smart enough to only copy what's
  changed
  
---
#Shell expansions and using the *

* The shell can expand file or directory names for you
* If you wanted to get all the files that started with 'test' and move
  them into a folder

        $ touch test1 test2 test_ing test.out notes
		$ mkdir my_tests
		$ ls
		my_tests notes  test.out  test1  test2  test_ing  testfile1
		$ mv test* my_tests
		$ ls
		my_tests  notes
		$ ls my_tests
		test.out  test1  test2  test_ing  testfile1
* The * means match anything, 0-multiple times
* Other options '?' mean match one chacter, 0 or 1 times

---
#Read the manual

* `man` is a built in utility that prints out help and usage for
  programs
* very useful to find out what a tool does or how to use it
* `man man` tells you how to use 'man'

		NAME
		man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals

		SYNOPSIS
		man  [-C  file]  [-d]  [-D]  [--warnings[=warnings]]
		[-R encoding] [-L locale] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-S
		list] [-e extension] [-i|-I] [--regex|--wildcard]
		[--names-only] [-a]  [-u]  [--no-subpages]  [-P  pager]
		[-r prompt] [-7] [-E encoding] [--no-hyphenation]
		[--no-justification] 

		DESCRIPTION
		man  is  the system's manual pager. Each page argument given
		to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.
		The manual page associated with each of these arguments is
		then found and displayed. A section, if  provided,  will
		direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The
		default action is to search in all of the available sections,
		following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page
		found,  even  if page exists in several sections.

#Some reminders / gotchas

* UNIX is case sensitive
* spaces in filenames and folders are annoying - to use them you need to Escape them with a \ or enclose in quotes

		$ mkdir "The End"
		$ rmdir The End # this will fail
		$ rmdir The\ End #or
		$ rmdir "The End"

---
#Home

* This is your homebase directory, when you login you will end up here
* `cd` with no other arguments will take you here
* You'll have some configuration files and other things stored here
* For this class most of your work will take place in this folder

---
#Reading files: more or less

* seeing contents of files with `more` or `less`
* page at a time view
* search within, use the '/' to search


---
#Creating files and Editors

* Creating text files with editors in UNIX - this is what you have to
  do to program.
* Typically used tools are `vi` `emacs` `nano`
* On Mac - try TextEdit or TextWrangler
* Practice using the text editor

---
#Command line programs

* anatomy of running a program
* the program name comes first. It can be just the name `ls` or the
  full path to the program `/bin/ls`
  
        $ ls
		$ /bin/ls

* arguments to the program come next. Some can be named with an
  argument like `program -i input -o output`
* or the program can just have a set of arguments like `cat file1 file2 file3`
* Instead of having output be printed to the screen it can be captured to a file

        $ ls > listing
		$ more listing
		$ cat file1 file2 file3 > all_files
