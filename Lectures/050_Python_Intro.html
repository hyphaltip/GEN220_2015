      # Python

      [Python](http://python.org) is one of many scripting languages. Others include
      [Perl](http://www.perl.org), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/),
      and even the Bash/Shell programming we've been talking about.

      It is a script because we write the code in a text file and then
      run it directly with an interpreter.  Before when we ran a
      script in bash/shell we would do
      ```shell
      $ bash myscript.sh
      ```

      To run code for python we will do
      ```shell
      $ python myscript.py
      ```

      #A first script

      Here's a text file that is called 'hello.py' and contains the following
      ```python
      print("Hello World!")
      ```

      ```shell
      $ python hello.py
      hello world
      $ python hello.py > message.txt  # can redirect the output
      $ cat message.txt
      hello world
      ```

      #The Python interpreter

      The Python interpreter is a program we run, giving it a file or
      script which specifies the actions for it to take.

      One can also just run the interpreter on the command line and
      interact with it directly. Just execute the python command on
      the command line.

      ```python
      $ python
      Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct  3 2015, 13:37:56)
      [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)] on darwin
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>> print "hello world"
      hello world
      ```

      ---
      #Some math with the interpreter

      ```python
      >>> 3+10
      13
      >>> 33/13
      2
      >>> 33/13.0
      2.5384615384615383
      >>> 2**10   # 2^10
      1024
      >>> (909+951) / 2.0 # Parenthees make a difference
      930
      >>> 909+951/2.0
      1384      
      ```

      #Modules: for Math

      Python has the concept of modules or libraries that contain
      routines we can re-use. We will spend more time on the types of
      modules that exist (the list if vast!).
      Here we will use the
      [math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) module which
      definese many routines.
      
      ```python
      >>> sqrt(9)
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined
      >>> import math
      >>> math.sqrt(9)
      3
      >>> math.pow(2,10)
      1024.0
      >>> 33/13.0
      2.5384615384615383
      >>> math.ceil(33/13.0) # round up
      3.0
      >>> math.floor(33/13.0) # round down
      2.0
      >>> round(2.2) # round works as you expect for rounding (&lt;.5)
      2.0
      >>> round(2.6) # round works as you expect for rounding (&gt;=.5)
      3.0
      ```

      #Strings

      ```python
      >>> 'break dance'
      'break dance'
      >>> "break dance"
      'break dance'
      >>> "don't break dance"
      "don't break dance"
      >>> 'don\'t break dance'
      "don't break dance"
      ```
