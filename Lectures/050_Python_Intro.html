      # Python

      [Python](http://python.org) is one of many scripting languages. Others include
      [Perl](http://www.perl.org), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/),
      and even the Bash/Shell programming we've been talking about.

      It is a script because we write the code in a text file and then
      run it directly with an interpreter.  Before when we ran a
      script in bash/shell we would do
      ```shell
      $ bash myscript.sh
      ```

      To run code for python we will do
      ```shell
      $ python myscript.py
      ```
      
      ---
      #A first script

      Here's a text file that is called 'hello.py' and contains the following
      ```python
      print("Hello World!")
      ```

      ```shell
      $ python hello.py
      hello world
      $ python hello.py > message.txt  # can redirect the output
      $ cat message.txt
      hello world
      ```
            
      ---
      #The Python interpreter

      The Python interpreter is a program we run, giving it a file or
      script which specifies the actions for it to take.

      One can also just run the interpreter on the command line and
      interact with it directly. Just execute the python command on
      the command line.

      ```python
      $ python
      Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct  3 2015, 13:37:56)
      [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)] on darwin
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>> print "hello world"
      hello world
      ```

      ---
      #Some math with the interpreter

      ```python
      >>> 3+10
      13
      >>> 33/13
      2
      >>> 33/13.0
      2.5384615384615383
      >>> 2**10   # 2^10
      1024
      >>> (909+951) / 2.0 # Parenthees make a difference
      930
      >>> 909+951/2.0
      1384      
      ```

      ---
      #Modules: for Math

      Python has the concept of modules or libraries that contain
      routines we can re-use. We will spend more time on the types of
      modules that exist (the list if vast!).
      Here we will use the
      [math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) module which
      definese many routines.
      
      ```python
      >>> sqrt(9)
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined
      >>> import math
      >>> math.sqrt(9)
      3
      >>> math.pow(2,10)
      1024.0
      >>> 33/13.0
      2.5384615384615383
      >>> math.ceil(33/13.0) # round up
      3.0
      >>> math.floor(33/13.0) # round down
      2.0
      >>> round(2.2) # round works as you expect for rounding (&lt;.5)
      2.0
      >>> round(2.6) # round works as you expect for rounding (&gt;=.5)
      3.0
      ```

      ---
      # Other math capabilities

      The % operator is modulus - it means return the remainder after
      dividing by the number. It is useful to see if something divides
      evenly into a number

      ```python
      >>> 10 / 3
      3
      >>> 10 % 3  # 10 / 3 is 3 with remainder of 1
      1
      >>> 10 / 2
      5
      >>> 10 % 2   # 10 / 2 is 5 with a remainder of 0
      0
      ```
      This can be useful to see if something is "Modulo" something (or
      Mod) -- really useful when looking at sequence data and checking
      to see if it will translate -- is the length/value mod 3 == 0 -
      means it is divisible perfectly by 3.
      
      ---
      #Strings

      Quotes can define the different special characters and use of
      strings
      
      ```python
      >>> 'break dance'
      'break dance'
      >>> "break dance"
      'break dance'
      >>> "don't break dance"
      "don't break dance"
      >>> 'don\'t break dance'
      "don't break dance"
      >>> ('concatenate ' 'these ' 'together')
      'concatenate these together'
      ```      
      ---
      # Variables

      Data can be assigned to variables. Variables don't exist until
      they are declared.

      The = is used for assignment. Some modifiers allow for modifying
      variable in place
      * += add to the value of the variable
      * -=, /=, *= are other 
      
      ```python
      >>> d = 0 # declare the variable d
      >>> print "d is " + d
      d is 0
      >>> print "e is " + e
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      NameError: name 'e' is not defined
      >>> d=8*7
      >>> print d
      56
      >>> d += 100
      >>> print d
      156
      ```      

      ---
      # String functions
      Documented well in the python [string](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html?highlight=string) library code.
      
      * string.find(substring,[,starting[,end]])
      Find a substring within a string
      
      ```python
      >>> str = "Jumping cow over the moon"
      >>> str.find("cow")
      8
      >>> str.find("o") # start searching from beginning
      9
      >>> str.find("o",12) # start searching after character 12
      22 
      ```

      * string.split(separator, max_split)
      Split a string into a list based on a separator (great for
      column delimited data!). max_splits specifies if it should stop
      after N separators are found
      
      ```python
      >>> str = "Jumping cow over the moon"
      >>> str.split(" ")
      ['Jumping', 'cow', 'over', 'the', 'moon']
      >>> str.split(" ",2)
      ['Jumping', 'cow', 'over the moon']
      ```

      ---
      #substring - extracting parts of a larger string
      You can query the string with the [ ] operator to get a subset
      of the string
      ```python
      >>> msg="I am a golden god!"
      >>> msg[:4] # everything before position 4
      'I am'
      >>> msg[7:13] # get a middle part from 7-15
      'golden'
      >>> msg[14:] # get from 14 to the end
      'god!'
      
      ---
      #Lists

      For collecting enumerated items

      ```python
      >>> l = [ 2, 3, 5]
      >>> l[0] # lists start at 0
      2
      >>> l[1:3]
      3,5
      >>> l.append(10)
      >>> print l
      [2, 3, 5, 10]     
      ```
      The sum function will summate a list
      ```python
      >>> sum(l)
      10
      ```

      ---
      #Lists other tools

      List comprehension -- we will do more on this when we cover
      loops in next lecture.

      ```python
      squares = []
      for x in range(10):
          squares.append(x**2)
      print squares
      [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
      # can also use this syntax to build it up
      squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
      ```

      ---
      #Using split to parse strings
      Starting with strings containing several parts which
      encode information you want.

      ```text
      Symbol:NASDAQ=AAPL;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=111.29,Close=109.56
      Symbol:NASDAQ=MSFT;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=46.65,Close=46.53
      Symbol:NYSE=MMM;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=149.0,Close=148.64
      ```
      What if we want to extract the 'AAPL','MSFT','MMM' and the
      Opening share price?  Let's use split for this as one way to do
      it.
      ```python
      >>> q =
      "Symbol:NASDAQ=AAPL;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=111.29,Close=109.56"
      >>> types = q.split(";")
      >>> print types
      ['Symbol:NASDAQ=AAPL', 'Date:2015-10-01',
      'Performance:Open=111.29,Close=109.56']
      >>> symbolset = types[0].split(":")
      >>> print symbolset
      ['Symbol', 'NASDAQ=AAPL']      
      >>> symbol = symbolset[1].split("=")
      >>> symbol
      ['NASDAQ', 'AAPL']
      >>> print symbol[1]
      'AAPL'
      ```

      #Documentation and Comments

      Comment lines start with a '#'

      There are also othe self-documentation feature to make it easy
      to generate readable documention for web or other sites. These
      are flanked with three double quotes like
      ```python
      """Documentation here"""      
      # can also be on multiple lines
      """This message could be concise, on multiple lines, and
      later I could tell you more about
      my program or function"""
      ```

      ---
      #Print information out

      print can accomodate a lot of types of data but it doesn't know
      how to mix types that well
      ```python
      >>> l = [7, 8, 9]
      >>> print l
      [7, 8, 9]
      >>> print "the list is " + l      
      TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects
      >>> print "the list is " + str(l)
      the list is [7, 8, 9]
      >>> print "the first item in the list is " + l[0] 
      TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
      >>> print "the first item in the list is " + str(l[0])
      the first item in the list is 7      
      # use the repr function to also print out the represenetation of
      #an object
      >>> print "the square of 8 is " + repr(8**2)
      the square of 8 is 64
      ```
      ---
      #repr function to display an object/string/number

      ```python
      # use repr to print out literally the string
      >>> hello = 'hello world\n'
      >>> print hello
      hello world
      >>> print repr(hello)
      'hello world\n'
      ```
      ---
      #More fancy printing
      
      Can use formatting to print some things out
      ```python
      >>> n = [1, 2, 'oh my god']
      >>> print n
      [1, 2, 'oh my god']
      # print things out with fancier printing
      >>> print n[0].rjust(5), n[1].rjust(5), n[2].ljust(10)
      AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'rjust'

      >>> print repr(n[0]).rjust(5), repr(n[1]).rjust(5), n[2].ljust(10)
          1     2 oh my god
      >>> print repr(n[0]).ljust(5), repr(n[1]).rjust(5), n[2].ljust(10)
      1         2 oh my god
      >>> print repr(n[0]).ljust(5), repr(n[1]).rjust(5), n[2].rjust(10)
          1     2  oh my god
      >>> print repr(n[0]).rjust(5), repr(n[1]).rjust(5), n[2].rjust(12)
          1     2    oh my god
      >>> print repr(n[0]).rjust(5), repr(n[1]).rjust(5), n[2].ljust(12)
          1     2 oh my god
      ```

      ---
      #Print out with placeholders

      ```python
      >>> a = 15
      >>> b = 41
      >>> print "a + b = ", a+b
      a + b =  56
      >>> print "{} + {} = {}".format(a,b,a+b)
      15 + 41 = 56
      >>> print "{} ({}) + {} ({}) = {}".format("a",a,"b",b,a+b)
      a (15) + b (41) = 56
      ```

      #Problems to try in class

      Using command line python (e.g. start it up without any
      arguments)
      1. Determine what 2146 divided by 13 is. Show with floating
      point.

      #Logic with if statements & importance of indentation

      if / elif / else are used to apply logic. This plus loops is the
      essence of programming.

      Note this requires you indent your code to indicate the level of
      the if statement
      
      ```python
      x=10
      if x &lt; 0:
          print "x is positive: ", x
      elif x &gt; 0:
          print "x is negative: ", x
      else:
          print "x is 0: ", x      
      ```

      ---
      #Loops
      Iterate through lists or based on logic. Here we count up from 1 to 10
      ```python
      for n in range(1,11):
          print "n is ", n
          if n % 2 == 0:
             print "n is even"
      #iterate over a range based on a list
      a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
      for i in range(len(a)):
          print i, a[i]
      ```
      ```python
      n is  1
      n is  2
      n is even
      n is  3
      n is  4
      n is even
      ...
      0 Mary
      1 had
      2 a
      3 little
      4 lamb
      ```

      ---
      #Loops can also count backwards
      ```python
      for n in range(10,-1,-1):
          print n
      10
      9
      8
      7
      6
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
      0
      ```
      ---
      #Loops over plus lists
      
      ```python
      stocks = [
      'Symbol:NASDAQ=AAPL;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=111.29,Close=109.56',
      'Symbol:NASDAQ=MSFT;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=46.65,Close=46.53',
      'Symbol:NYSE=MMM;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=149.0,Close=148.64']

      for ticker in stocks:
          print ticker

      print # empty line
      for ticker in stocks:
          parts = ticker.split(";")
          symbolset = parts[0].split(":")
          symbol = symbolset[1].split("=")
          print symbol[1]
      ```
      produces
      ```python
      Symbol:NASDAQ=AAPL;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=111.29,Close=109.56
      Symbol:NASDAQ=MSFT;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=46.65,Close=46.53
      Symbol:NYSE=MMM;Date:2015-10-01;Performance:Open=149.0,Close=148.64

      AAPL
      MSFT
      MMM
      ```

      ---
      #Iterate over a string

      Can use for loops on strings as well
      ```python
      dna="AAGATCAGGAC"
      for c in dna:
          print "DNA base is " + c
      ```
