      # Python

      [Python](http://python.org) is one of many scripting languages. Others include
      [Perl](http://www.perl.org), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/),
      and even the Bash/Shell programming we've been talking about.

      It is a script because we write the code in a text file and then
      run it directly with an interpreter.  Before when we ran a
      script in bash/shell we would do
      ```shell
      $ bash myscript.sh
      ```

      To run code for python we will do
      ```shell
      $ python myscript.py
      ```
      
      ---
      #A first script

      Here's a text file that is called 'hello.py' and contains the following
      ```python
      print("Hello World!")
      ```

      ```shell
      $ python hello.py
      hello world
      $ python hello.py > message.txt  # can redirect the output
      $ cat message.txt
      hello world
      ```
            
      ---
      #The Python interpreter

      The Python interpreter is a program we run, giving it a file or
      script which specifies the actions for it to take.

      One can also just run the interpreter on the command line and
      interact with it directly. Just execute the python command on
      the command line.

      ```python
      $ python
      Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct  3 2015, 13:37:56)
      [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)] on darwin
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>> print "hello world"
      hello world
      ```

      ---
      #Some math with the interpreter

      ```python
      >>> 3+10
      13
      >>> 33/13
      2
      >>> 33/13.0
      2.5384615384615383
      >>> 2**10   # 2^10
      1024
      >>> (909+951) / 2.0 # Parenthees make a difference
      930
      >>> 909+951/2.0
      1384      
      ```

      ---
      #Modules: for Math

      Python has the concept of modules or libraries that contain
      routines we can re-use. We will spend more time on the types of
      modules that exist (the list if vast!).
      Here we will use the
      [math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) module which
      definese many routines.
      
      ```python
      >>> sqrt(9)
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined
      >>> import math
      >>> math.sqrt(9)
      3
      >>> math.pow(2,10)
      1024.0
      >>> 33/13.0
      2.5384615384615383
      >>> math.ceil(33/13.0) # round up
      3.0
      >>> math.floor(33/13.0) # round down
      2.0
      >>> round(2.2) # round works as you expect for rounding (&lt;.5)
      2.0
      >>> round(2.6) # round works as you expect for rounding (&gt;=.5)
      3.0
      ```

      ---
      # Other math capabilities

      The % operator is modulus - it means return the remainder after
      dividing by the number. It is useful to see if something divides
      evenly into a number

      ```python
      >>> 10 / 3
      3
      >>> 10 % 3  # 10 / 3 is 3 with remainder of 1
      1
      >>> 10 / 2
      5
      >>> 10 % 2   # 10 / 2 is 5 with a remainder of 0
      0
      ```
      This can be useful to see if something is "Modulo" something (or
      Mod) -- really useful when looking at sequence data and checking
      to see if it will translate -- is the length/value mod 3 == 0 -
      means it is divisible perfectly by 3.
      
      ---
      #Strings

      Quotes can define the different special characters and use of
      strings
      
      ```python
      >>> 'break dance'
      'break dance'
      >>> "break dance"
      'break dance'
      >>> "don't break dance"
      "don't break dance"
      >>> 'don\'t break dance'
      "don't break dance"
      >>> ('concatenate ' 'these ' 'together')
      'concatenate these together'
      ```      
      ---
      # Variables

      Data can be assigned to variables. Variables don't exist until
      they are declared.

      The = is used for assignment. Some modifiers allow for modifying
      variable in place
      * += add to the value of the variable
      * -=, /=, *= are other 
      
      ```python
      >>> d = 0 # declare the variable d
      >>> print "d is " + d
      d is 0
      >>> print "e is " + e
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      NameError: name 'e' is not defined
      >>> d=8*7
      >>> print d
      56
      >>> d += 100
      >>> print d
      156
      ```

      # String functions
      Documented well in the python [string](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html?highlight=string) library code.
      
      * string.find(substring,[,starting[,end]])
      Find a substring within a string
      
      ```python
      >>> str = "Jumping cow over the moon"
      >>> str.find("cow")
      8
      >>> str.find("o") # start searching from beginning
      9
      >>> str.find("o",12) # start searching after character 12
      22 
      ```

      * string.split(separator, max_split)
      Split a string into a list based on a separator (great for
      column delimited data!). max_splits specifies if it should stop
      after N separators are found
      
      ```python
      >>> str = "Jumping cow over the moon"
      >>> str.split(" ")
      ['Jumping', 'cow', 'over', 'the', 'moon']
      >>> str.split(" ",2)
      ['Jumping', 'cow', 'over the moon']
      ```
      
      ---
      #Lists

      For collecting enumerated items

      ```python
      >>> l = [ 2, 3, 5]
      >>> l[0] # lists start at 0
      2
      >>> l[1:3]
      3,5
      >>> l.append(10)
      >>> print l
      [2, 3, 5, 10]     
      ```
      The sum function will summate a list
      ```python
      >>> sum(l)
      10
      ```

      ---
      #Lists other tools

      List comprehension -- we will do more on this when we cover
      loops in next lecture.

      ```python
      squares = []
      for x in range(10):
          squares.append(x**2)
      print squares
      [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
      # can also use this syntax to build it up
      squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
      ```

      #Documentation and Comments

      Comment lines start with a '#'

      There are also othe self-documentation feature to make it easy
      to generate readable documention for web or other sites. These
      are flanked with three double quotes like
      """Documentation here"""      

      ---
      #Print information out

      print can accomodate a lot of types of data but it doesn't know
      how to mix types that well
      ```python
      >>> l = [7, 8, 9]
      >>> print l
      [7, 8, 9]
      >>> print "the list is " + l      
      TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'list' objects
      >>> print "the list is " + l[0]     
      TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
      
      ```
      Can use formatting to print some things out
      
      There are several
