      # Data structures in Python

      ---
      # Outline

      * Arrays / Lists
      * Sets
      * Dictionaries
      * Objects

      ---
      #Dictionaries
      (from
      https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)
      
      Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary
      (see [Mapping Types —
      dict](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)).
      Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as
      “associative memories” or “associative arrays”.

      Unlike sequences (_arrays_), which are indexed by a range of numbers,
      dictionaries are indexed by __keys__, which can be any immutable
      type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used
      as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a
      tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly,
      it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since
      lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice
      assignments, or methods like append() and extend()."
